- Out the PWM with Dead-band (using PSMC module on PIC16F1788)

- Read The sensor input (metal detection sensor): refer to http://www.academia.edu/16907163/metal_detection
for more information

- Process the sensor input to detect the distance of metal, indicate by LED blinking

- Send the data to UART to plot real-time signal on PC
